# Recommended books
- All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference (Springer Texts in Statistics) by Larry Wasserman.
  - Touches most parts of statistics. It's pretty approachable. Recommended.

- Essentials of Statistical Inference (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics) 1st Edition by G. A. Young and R.L. Smith. Pretty approachable.
  - It presents things in a more presentable way. Contains a decent introdution for hypothesis testing under both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks.

- Probability and Stochastics (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Vol. 261) 1st Edition by Erhan Çınlar. My favorite book on probability.
  - Dense but thorough on the theory. Great for learning probability if you have a math background. Focused on probability, no statistics to be found.

- Theory of Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics) by Mark J. Schervish.
  - Very Dense but thorough on the theory. Leans Bayesian but bandles both Frequentist viewpoints as well. Spends no time on the computational side of things. Kinda-sorta recommended for more pure mathy folks.

## Recommended papers

- Relationship Between Bayesian and Frequentist Sample Size Determination by L. Inoue, D. Berry, and G. Parmigiani. 
  - An approachable paper on the relationship between Bayesian and Frequentist sample size determination. It's a relatively like read.
